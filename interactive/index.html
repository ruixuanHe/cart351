      <a href="">Firecrackers</a>
      <p class="sectionP">Firecracker hangings are hung outside homes to scare off evil spirits and misfortune on New Years Eve. They are symbolic of the noisy firecrackers which frightened away the legendary monster Nian</p>

      <a href="">Tangerines and Oranges</a>
      <p class="sectionP">Both of these fruits are important Chinese New Year symbols that represent abundant happiness. The reason for this is that the Chinese word for tangerine sounds like the word for 'luck' and the Chinese word for orange sounds like the Chinese word for 'wealth'. So at Chinese New Year these fruits are laid out in the home to bring good luck and good fortune in the coming year. When visiting other people it is usual to take a gift of a bag of oranges and tangerines.</p>

    <div class="section" style="background-color: #ffc2b3">
      <a href="">Fish</a>
      <p class="sectionP">At Chinese New Year, these Chinese fish decorations are everywhere. The reason for this is that the Chinese word for 'fish' sounds exactly the same as the Chinese word for 'abundance' which means having more than you need of something. By hanging up fish decorations Chinese people are hoping that in the New Year they will have wealth and prosperity.</p>
